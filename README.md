# Simon
This is my way to implement my own version of the Simon game. It is both a way to practice my C# skills and a way to try to make one of my favorite games I used to play as a kid.

## The Game
In Simon, the game is played in terms of rounds. Each round has a unique sequence of lights that are lit up in a certain order. The sequence is shown at the beginning of each round by the computer and, once it's done playing the sequence, it is up to the user to attempt to copy the same light pattern.
